      <h2><p>What will I find here?</p></h2>
      <p>Here you will see the foundations of how I created the site throughout the course using VS Code, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will be describing the methods I used to be able to create the final product you’re currently seeing. It may not be much, but it’s something!

      <h2>What should I expect to see?</h2>
      <p>You should be able to see three web pages available to you - each lead to their own unique page with different aspects of coding. We have the ‘Home’ page, which is where you are right now! The ‘Gallery’ where you’ll be able to see the coding process through screenshots. And finally, the ‘About’ page where you can find extra information that goes into more detail about the style processing.</p>

      <h2>Why did I make this website?</h2>
      <p>This website was created to demonstrate my skills as a beginner web developer while being tutored and guided by Madlab’s Shift Click website development course. Personally, I see this as an opportunity to branch out my knowledge in IT to help me accelerate certain learning prospects for future career development. But in the meantime, feel free to have a look around at what I’ve been able to create! It’ll be a while.
